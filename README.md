# Requirements
-   Intel x64 architecture processor
-   CMake 3.29 or newer
-   C compiler supporting C 17

-   Using command prompt (terminal, powershell ...) go to the build directory with "cd (path)" command
-   Type cmake ..
-   Type cd ..
-   Type cmake --build (build directory)
-   After the installation program should be located in {repo}/executables or {repo}/exectubales/Debug
-   To run the program simply type "./Fractal.exe {width} {height}" in terminal while being in the same
    directory as the program, where {width} and {height} are desired width and height of the window.
